The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process followed for a software project within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan 
describing developing, maintaining, replacing, altering or enhancing specific software. 

As DevOps engineers, it is their job to provide high-quality software that meets or exceeds the expectations of their clients within the time and cost estimates.
