Systems Development Life Cycle

Introduction
-------------------------------

Systems development life cycle refers to the various phases an application goes through from 
initial conception to release and possibly beyond.
There are various types of SDLCs such as waterfall where an application goes
from planning to release and never returns to a previous step to other types such as Agile
where it is cyclical and reversing steps and fixing issues is easier.

DevOps SDLC
-------------------------------

DevOps is like agile as it is in a loop however it puts more emphasis on the 
combination and collaboration of development and operations
where development consist of planning, coding, building, and testing 
while operations consist of release, deployment, operation, and monitoring.
Through the collaboration of both development and operations, the ideas of DevOps allows for 
things such as automated tasks, better security, and quicker releases.
